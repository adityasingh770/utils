#### Overriding Python json.dumps()
    class JSONSetEncoder(json.JSONEncoder):
        def default(self, obj):
            if isinstance(obj, set):
                return list(obj)
            return json.JSONEncoder.default(self, obj)
<!-- This code defines a custom JSON encoder class named JSONSetEncoder that inherits from json.JSONEncoder. The purpose of this class is to handle the encoding of sets when converting Python objects to JSON.

The default method is overridden in this class. This method is called by the encoder for objects that are not serializable by default. In this case, it checks if the object (obj) is an instance of a set using isinstance(obj, set). If it is a set, it converts it to a list using list(obj) before encoding.

So, whenever you use json.dumps() to convert a Python object to a JSON-formatted string and pass cls=JSONSetEncoder as an argument, this custom encoder will be used, ensuring that sets are converted to lists during the JSON serialization process. -->
